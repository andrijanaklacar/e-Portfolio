									<summary><b>Reflective Activity 1</b></summary>
									<br>
									<pre>
<b>Introduction</b>

This reflective activity will be based on the assumption that the computing
professional in question is an employee of a private clinic and is responsible
for setting up an online appointment booking and scheduling with an additional
feature of online payments using the clinic’s system. This clinic is assumed to
be based in the United Kingdom (UK) and personal information such as: full names,
email addresses, phone numbers, patients’ addresses, ID numbers, and credit card
details will be stored in the clinic’s databases.

<b>Ethical Issues Identified</b>

Stahl’s et al. (2016) paper has touched upon several ethical issues regarding the
information technology sector. The following four issues have been chosen to be the
most relevant, accurate, and urgent issues based on the assumed organisation 
mentioned earlier:
<li> Consent and privacy issues; The system is expected to collect personal and
sensitive data of the clinic’s patients who wish to proceed with the online booking
method. Consent and privacy issues should be prioritised.</li>
<li>Age-related issues; Elders are less likely to use and adapt to the new and complex
technology, as well as the Internet (Guner & Acarturk, 2020).</li>
<li>Harm, misuse, deception issues; This issue was considered important, as there 
is always a chance of malicious activity by insiders (i.e., clinic’s staff) 
(Al-Harrasi et al., 2021). Clinic members and staff should have adequate and frequent 
training of the importance of ethics and the importance of data breaches.</li>
<li>Inclusion issues; This type of issue was included due to a percentage of people not
having the adequate resources (smart devices, weak or no internet connections, etcetera)
to use the newly adopted system by the clinic for appointment scheduling.</li>

<b>Actions to Take and Impact of Actions</b>

As a computing professional, there are three types of actions to consider in order to 
address the aforementioned ethical issues within the clinic. These are the:
<li>Legal Issues</li>
<li>Ethical and Social Issues</li>
<li>Professional/Technical Issues</li>

<i>Legal Issues</i>

In the UK there are some Acts, regulations, and standards which refer to data, data breaches,
and payments and all organisations in the country should be compliant with these. For example, 
the Data Protection Act 1998 (Legislation, 2022a) refers to the way an individual’s personal 
information may be used by organisations, businesses, and government, as well as one’s right 
to ask for their personal information. Following up is the Computer Misuse Act 1990 
(Legislation, 2022b). This Act refers to the security of any computer material and factors that
could breach this security are unauthorised access and/or modification of one’s data. Lastly,
since the system can ask for credit card details, the Payment Card Industry Data Security 
Standard (PCI DSS) (PCI Security Standards Council, 2021) should be reviewed. This standard 
provides an insight on security standards and its goal is to secure any debit or credit card
transactions from data theft and/or fraud.

<i>Ethical/Social and Technical Issues</i>

As there are indeed several ethical issues that need to be addressed, a computing professional
is obliged to address them. To begin with, the clinic’s system is bound to store sensitive and
personal data of patients and staff and is therefore it is required that patients and staff 
should be asked for data consent and privacy (Shaw & Erren, 2021; Price & Cohen, 2019). Other 
issues that were identified were the age and inclusion issues. These can be prevented, minimised,
and avoided by ensuring the clinic does not fully substitute the online booking system with the
traditional way. Another way of minimising the issue is to make the system more accessible and
beginner-friendly for those who struggle with technology, as they will be more intrigued and 
accept the system easier (Chang et al., 2019), with a brief yet detailed training on how to use 
the system. As mentioned earlier, not all are familiar with technology, and not every patient is
required to own adequate resources to book an appointment with the clinic.

Last but not least, adequate training in ethics, privacy, and cyberattacks/cybercrimes should be 
done at least once per year. With the rates of cybercrime and cyberattacks rapidly increasing 
worldwide, it is of great importance that this factor should be addressed thoroughly. Training and
education should not only be included for the usage of the platform, but it should also be included
in one’s induction period to ensure that malicious insiders are warned and/or discouraged. Everyone
involved with the clinic, including patients, should be informed about cyberattacks such as phishing,
data breaches, etcetera and the clinic should have constantly updated cybersecurity policies and best
practices (Rahman et al., 2020; Aldawood & Skinner, 2019; Li, et al., 2019).

<b>Conclusion</b>

Adopting new technology in an organisation is never easy, as there will always be ethical, legal, and 
technical issues that should be considered, reviewed, and addressed. In this activity, a clinic’s 
appointment scheduling system identified a few ethical issues, as well as legal and technical ones.
Data consent is a must when collecting data, while technology is not familiar to everyone; therefore, 
it cannot solely replace the human factor in organisations, government, and businesses. Training and 
education are two vital factors when it comes to any digitalisation process, as cybersecurity is 
important to ensure ethics and data security.

This quiz was based on inductive and deductive logic. We were asked to choose
whether each statement was deductive or inductive. I attempted this quiz twice.
The first attempt I got 4/6 questions correct. I was a bit confused as to why the
other two were wrong since I do not think that all cats have a keen smell, some
might not be able to smell at all. Also, I did not think that all football players
weighted more than 170 pounds. I assumed that since the statements had the keyword
<b><i>all</i></b>, I should have assumed that those statements were true.

This unit focused on the ethical aspect of cybersecurity and responsible research.
I believe ethics, escpecially in work environments, should be in any organisation's
priority list. Toxic work environments are considered to negatively affect one's
productivity, while this decrease in productivity could lead to job burnouts (Anjum
et. al., 2018). As someone who has heard stories of friends and family and toxic
environments, I try keeping in mind that my mental health and happiness are more
important than salaries and money. The collaborative discussion was a great reminder
of this morale.

Conducting research is never easy, at least for me. I believe there are a lot of 
loopholes to watch out for, such as irrelevant, outdated, untrusted and non-reliable
sources. Although university's guidelines are straight-forward when it comes to 
referencing, I found that Nulli's et. al. (2018) article included a very clear, 
informative, and helpful table, which I will address to when researching.

I enjoy researching and reading about topics I find intriguing, but this 
unit was a bit confusing and a bit stressful. Although we had the freedom
to choose a literature review topic, I did not know how to write a
literature review or where to even start. However, the lecturecast,
literature review guide questions provided by Healy et. al. (2020), and 
some further research I have done gave me an insight on how it should
look like.

This unit focused on the research methods. Although I did not choose or
thought about my capstone project topic, the information on research methods
(BRM, n.d.) made me think about the approach I would personally like to follow,
upon deciding on my project topic. Since I have not made up my mind yet on a
topic, I chose to proceed with the chosen topic for literature review in unit 1
for the upcoming assessments.

This unit focused on research methods such as case studies, focus groups,
and quantitative and qualitative observations. Although I am unsure about
my research proposal for my dissertation, I would like my topic to have
the ability to use questionnaires and quantitatively analyse my data.

This week we had to submit our literature review outlines, for which I
found structuring my points and sections of this lit review very
intimidating, even though I have completed written essays for
this program and reports for my BSc modules.

Questionnaires and surveys are one of the few methods I think
I will need for my upcoming capstone project. Although, I have 
yet to decide on what I would like to focus on, I believe the
second reflective activity and reading material helped me
understand how to ethically create a questionnaire appropriate
enough for a dissertation. It helped me realise that it is important
to not be biased, as the results of a biased survey could have a 
negative impact when analysing these results. If I do use surveys
for my capstone project, I would want to design it in a way that
it shows rectitude.

For this week we also got our feedback on the collaborative discussion.
The major key points were:

<img src="images/CLQfeedback.png" alt="CLQ Feedback" width = "600" height = "434"/>

Based on my CLQ, I believe I have a couple of things to keep in mind,
such as keeping my paragraphs of roughly the same size. That is something I will
have to apply for the upcoming CLQ.

The wiki activity helped me 'visualise' unethical surveys, or even
surveys that have plenty of room for improvement. This activity
not only highlighted the importance of a well designed and ethical
survey, but it also gave us the chance to somehow put our knowledge
in practice.

Due to the data protection act and GDPR in general, I have to ensure
that when conducting and designing a survey, I must include a disclaimer
on how the participants' data will be used, for how long the data will
be held, etcetera.

For this unit we had to submit our Literature Review. This was
our very first summative assessment, hence this unit was a bit
more demanding, as there were a lot of final editing, reviewing,
and even some additional researching for the literature review.

The collaborative learning discussion was based on a case study
on accuracy of information. In our initial posts we had to include
the ethical aspect of reporting both negative and positive results,
as well as the legal aspect of it. I believe this is good practice
for our capstone project as we will have to analyse data as well.
It was a good reminder that negative results, although sometimes
unwanted or unexpected, are still results worth publishing in order
to follow ethical codes of conducts.

This week's work was focused on statistics, something I had covered
in my undergraduate studies. For our final research projects we would
have to know how to find means, medians, standard deviation, and other
statistical definitions highlighted in Berenson's et al. (2015) book.
However, I find statistics a bit confusing, hence I would have to study
the subject a bit more, before proceeding with my project.

Outlines are a great way of organising my thoughts, objectives, and aims
of a project, and they also give me the chance to not stress for deadlines.
For the research proposal outline, I have included the vital ethical
considerations I would want to apply to the project, as ethics has been a 
continuous concept of this master program and I aim to conduct an ethical
report.

For this unit I have chosen to focus on completing my summary
post. As this was our second collaborative discussions, I chose
to turn to our supervisor's feedback and try my best to apply
the points suggested to this summary post. As mentioned in previous
units, this particular collaborative discussion felt more like a brief
induction on our upcoming capstone project. Looking at the upcoming
presentation (Unit 10) brief, we have to include our ethical considerations.
Apart from the data consent, I will make sure that my results are reported
and analysed in an ethical way, without tampering data to get favourable results.

During week 8 and 9 we had to work on some worksheets in Excel. I have
not used Excel since my undergraduate capstone project, and therefore
found these worksheets a great practice. In the examples and exercises
the frequency function, class mark, mean, median, etcetera were reviewed.
The charts worksheets were also helpful as there was a constant pattern on 
their design, a practice I will use in the project.

Apart from the examples and exercises, we were provided with a short 
introduction to statistics, hypothesis testing, etcetera. Although I have
completed a few statistics modules in my BSc, I always found statistics a
bit confusing, and so the plan is to read and practice more on hypothesis
testing for the master's project.

This unit focused on e-Portfolios and our Professional Skills Matrix,
as well as our either SWOT analysis or Action Plan. I have decided
to go with the SWOT analysis this time, as I have used an Action Plan
in a previous module.

In the beginning of this master's program, I did not quite comprehend
why e-portfolio was a summative assessment for some of the modules,
mainly because I was not familiar with GitHub and also I always thought
that resumes must be brief, only highlighting the relevant and important
aspects of one's career path. One drawback of an e-Portfolio I
can see myself agreeing with Weber (2018), is the presentation of too much
information at once for the recruiter.

However, Weber's (2018) article on electronic portfolios made me realise
that not all recruiters are looking for brief resumes, and some of them
might require a more detailed and more specific presentation of one's skills.
Hence, an e-Portfolio can be useful in this instance, especially if recruiters
are not sure about the graduate's skills.

The self test quiz was a very straightforward activity which
was done to check whether certain definitions and practice
were identified correctly. It took 2 tries to get all questions
correct, as I had mistaken the project cycle as I did not see the
scoping in my first choice, and the risk transfer with the risk
acceptance. Small mistakes like these are often benefitial, as they
remind me that I should not rush and should take my time, in moderation,
for better results.

During this week feedback for our second collaborative discussion was
also given by our tutor. The major key points were:

As this was the last unit of the module, it felt more stressful, yet not
much work had to be done, as the e-portfolio was something I was working on
for the past twelve weeks. Overall, this module helped me prepare for my
upcoming capstone project, considering the ethical aspect of writing a
dissertation.
