										This quiz was based on inductive and deductive logic. We were asked to choose
										whether each statement was deductive or inductive. I attempted this quiz twice.
										The first attempt I got 4/6 questions correct. I was a bit confused as to why the
										other two were wrong since I do not think that all cats have a keen smell, some
										might not be able to smell at all. Also, I did not think that all football players
										weighted more than 170 pounds. I assumed that since the statements had the keyword <b><i>all</i></b>,
										 I should have assumed that those statements were true.

This unit focused on the ethical aspect of cybersecurity and responsible research. I believe ethics, escpecially 
in work environments, should be in any organisation's priority list. Toxic work environments are considered 
to negatively affect one's productivity, while this decrease in productivity could lead to job burnouts (Anjum
et. al., 2018). As someone who has heard stories of friends and family and toxic environments, I try keeping in 
mind that my mental health and happiness are more important than salaries and money. The collaborative discussion 
was a great reminder of this morale.

Conducting research is never easy, at least for me. I believe there are a lot of loopholes to watch out for, such 
as irrelevant, outdated, untrusted and non-reliable sources. Although university's guidelines are straight-forward 
when it comes to referencing, I found that Nulli's et. al. (2018) article included a very clear, informative, and 
helpful table, which I will address to when researching.

I enjoy researching and reading about topics I find intriguing, but this 
unit was a bit confusing and a bit stressful. Although we had the freedom
to choose a literature review topic, I did not know how to write a
literature review or where to even start. However, the lecturecast,
literature review guide questions provided by Healy et. al. (2020), and 
some further research I have done gave me an insight on how it should
look like.

This unit focused on the research methods. Although I did not choose or
thought about my capstone project topic, the information on research methods
(BRM, n.d.) made me think about the approach I would personally like to follow,
upon deciding on my project topic. Since I have not made up my mind yet on a
topic, I chose to proceed with the chosen topic for literature review in unit 1
for the upcoming assessments.

This unit focused on research methods such as case studies, focus groups,
and quantitative and qualitative observations. Although I am unsure about
my research proposal for my dissertation, I would like my topic to have
the ability to use questionnaires and quantitatively analyse my data.

This week we had to submit our literature review outlines, for which I
found structuring my points and sections of this lit review very
intimidating, even though I have completed written essays for
this program and reports for my BSc modules.

Questionnaires and surveys are one of the few methods I think
I will need for my upcoming capstone project. Although, I have 
yet to decide on what I would like to focus on, I believe the
second reflective activity and reading material helped me
understand how to ethically create a questionnaire appropriate
enough for a dissertation. It helped me realise that it is important
to not be biased, as the results of a biased survey could have a 
negative impact when analysing these results. If I do use surveys
for my capstone project, I would want to design it in a way that
it shows rectitude.

For this week we also got our feedback on the collaborative discussion.
The major key points were:

<img src="images/CLQfeedback.png" alt="CLQ Feedback" width = "600" height = "434"/>

Based on my CLQ, I believe I have a couple of things to keep in mind,
such as keeping my paragraphs of roughly the same size. That is something I will
have to apply for the upcoming CLQ.

The wiki activity helped me 'visualise' unethical surveys, or even
surveys that have plenty of room for improvement. This activity
not only highlighted the importance of a well designed and ethical
survey, but it also gave us the chance to somehow put our knowledge
in practice.

Due to the data protection act and GDPR in general, I have to ensure
that when conducting and designing a survey, I must include a disclaimer
on how the participants' data will be used, for how long the data will
be held, etcetera.

For this unit we had to submit our Literature Review. This was
our very first summative assessment, hence this unit was a bit
more demanding, as there were a lot of final editing, reviewing,
and even some additional researching for the literature review.

The collaborative learning discussion was based on a case study
on accuracy of information. In our initial posts we had to include
the ethical aspect of reporting both negative and positive results,
as well as the legal aspect of it. I believe this is good practice
for our capstone project as we will have to analyse data as well.
It was a good reminder that negative results, although sometimes
unwanted or unexpected, are still results worth publishing in order
to follow ethical codes of conducts.

This week's work was focused on statistics, something I had covered
in my undergraduate studies. For our final research projects we would
have to know how to find means, medians, standard deviation, and other
statistical definitions highlighted in Berenson's et al. (2015) book.
However, I find statistics a bit confusing, hence I would have to study
the subject a bit more, before proceeding with my project.

Outlines are a great way of organising my thoughts, objectives, and aims
of a project, and they also give me the chance to not stress for deadlines.
For the research proposal outline, I have included the vital ethical
considerations I would want to apply to the project, as ethics has been a 
continuous concept of this master program and I aim to conduct an ethical
report.

For this unit I have chosen to focus on completing my summary
post. As this was our second collaborative discussions, I chose
to turn to our supervisor's feedback and try my best to apply
the points suggested to this summary post. As mentioned in previous
units, this particular collaborative discussion felt more like a brief
induction on our upcoming capstone project. Looking at the upcoming
presentation (Unit 10) brief, we have to include our ethical considerations.
Apart from the data consent, I will make sure that my results are reported
and analysed in an ethical way, without tampering data to get favourable results.

During week 8 and 9 we had to work on some worksheets in Excel. I have
not used Excel since my undergraduate capstone project, and therefore
found these worksheets a great practice. In the examples and exercises
the frequency function, class mark, mean, median, etcetera were reviewed.
The charts worksheets were also helpful as there was a constant pattern on 
their design, a practice I will use in the project.

Apart from the examples and exercises, we were provided with a short 
introduction to statistics, hypothesis testing, etcetera. Although I have
completed a few statistics modules in my BSc, I always found statistics a
bit confusing, and so the plan is to read and practice more on hypothesis
testing for the master's project.

The self test quiz was a very straightforward activity which
was done to check whether certain definitions and practice
were identified correctly. It took 2 tries to get all questions
correct, as I had mistaken the project cycle as I did not see the
scoping in my first choice, and the risk transfer with the risk
acceptance. Small mistakes like these are often benefitial, as they
remind me that I should not rush and should take my time, in moderation,
for better results.

As this was the last unit of the module, it felt more stressful, yet not
much work had to be done, as the e-portfolio was something I was working on
for the past twelve weeks. Overall, this module helped me prepare for my
upcoming capstone project, considering the ethical aspect of writing a
dissertation.
