								<summary><b>Unit 1:</b></summary>
							<br>
							<p>In this unit, the four tenets (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and Non-repudiation) are introduced. Two major concepts in cybersecurity are also discussed; threats and vulnerabilities and their relation, classification and assessment.</p>

									<summary><b>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1: Threats and Vulnerabilities and Solutions for Mitigation of a Medical Mannequin</b></summary>
								<br>
								<p>The initial post is based on the paper "Compromising a Medical Mannequin Glisson" by W., Andel, T., McDonald, T., Jacobs, M., Campbell, M. & Mayr, J. (2015).</p>
								<pre>
Initial Post:

The paper (Glisson et. al., 2015) addresses the dependence of technology in medical training devices and the cyber
security vulnerabilities and threats due to this dependence. Integrating technology into the medical field 
automatically awakens malicious activity and attacks. This paper focuses on a production-deployed medical training
mannequin and its viability and shows that they can be successfully attacked. Once a medical device is breached, 
thousands of patients will be impacted, as medical staff will incorrectly analyse life threatening data.

The paper discusses two vulnerabilities the medical mannequin could have: the 802.11 wireless transmissions 
between the mannequin and the controlling laptops and the TCP network protocol. With the existence of 
vulnerabilities threats will constantly arise and, in this case, the threats to the vulnerabilities mentioned
above are brute force attacks and Denial of Service (DoS), respectively.

A strong security system is required in order to mitigate DoS attacks. Investing in an antivirus software, which
is constantly up to date, will achieve detection and prevention of potential viruses and malware that could harm
the network. Firewalls constructed to protect against these attacks may also be useful, as they can assist in 
monitoring and analysing network traffic (Velimirovic, 2021; Overby, 2021).

To reduce the risk of brute force attacks on the Wi-Fi Protected Setup WPS vulnerability (WPS) PIN, CISA (2013) 
suggested disabling the WPS if and where possible, as some vendors do not allow disabling it (Swan, N.D.). 
Swan (N.D.) also suggests updating the firmware when updates are available. Another solution to mitigating the 
risk of a brute force attack and making the attack “impractical” is the implementation of
“sufficiently long lock-down periods” (Viehböck, 2011).

									<summary><b>Team Contract</b></summary>
									<br>
									<p>In Unit 1 we were allocated to groups. Each group had to complete a Team Contract where team members discussed the goals, expectations, suggestions, procedures and policies of the upcoming group project.</p>
								</details>

							<details>
								<summary><b>Unit 2:</b></summary>
							<br>
							<p>Unit 2 is based on the Unit 1 paper on the medical mannequin. The learning outcomes of this unit are:
								<br>
								* Describing vulnerabilites of modern electronic devices.
								* Explaining exploitation of common vulnerabilities using software toolkits.
								* Using industry toolkit for classification and evaluation of threats and vulnerabilities.
							</p>
								<details>
									<summary><b>Seminar 1: STRIDE & DREAD Tools</b></summary>
									<br>
									<p>	* The seminar focused on the Microsoft STRIDE and DREAD tools, as discussed in Unit’s 1 lecturecast. The preparation for this seminar was to analyse the vulnerabilities discussed in the article (Unit 1) and analyse them using a 3 level DREAD rating (0 = no risk, 3 = maximum risk). During the live seminar each group presented a short PowerPoint presentation, prepared beforehand, on their DREAD analysis. Our group (Group 3) also mentioned some mitigation solutions for the vulnerabilities discussed in the paper, brute-force and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
										* The seminar offered a glance on what it is like being in a team and working in one, while simultaneously it offered teamwork skills. Due to different time zones and schedules, the teamwork immediately felt less easy, as there needed, and needs to be understanding of the two major factors that could impact a team’s work. Despite these complications, our group managed to work together by sharing documents and organised a meeting to finalise our presentation.

									<summary><b>Peer Responses</b></summary>
									<br>
									<p>	* In this unit we also had to respond to other’s Initial Posts that were posted in the Collaborative Discussion 1 Forum. Discussions and responding to some are enjoyable tasks, as it motivates us to research more and broaden our knowledge on the specific topic, in this case vulnerabilities and threats in the health industry.</p>
