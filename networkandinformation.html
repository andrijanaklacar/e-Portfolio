									<summary><b>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1: Threats and Vulnerabilities and Solutions for Mitigation of a Medical Mannequin</b></summary>
								<br>
								<p>The initial post is based on the paper "Compromising a Medical Mannequin Glisson" by W., Andel, T., McDonald, T., Jacobs, M., Campbell, M. & Mayr, J. (2015).</p>
								<pre>
Initial Post:

The paper (Glisson et. al., 2015) addresses the dependence of technology in medical training devices and the cyber
security vulnerabilities and threats due to this dependence. Integrating technology into the medical field 
automatically awakens malicious activity and attacks. This paper focuses on a production-deployed medical training
mannequin and its viability and shows that they can be successfully attacked. Once a medical device is breached, 
thousands of patients will be impacted, as medical staff will incorrectly analyse life threatening data.

The paper discusses two vulnerabilities the medical mannequin could have: the 802.11 wireless transmissions 
between the mannequin and the controlling laptops and the TCP network protocol. With the existence of 
vulnerabilities threats will constantly arise and, in this case, the threats to the vulnerabilities mentioned
above are brute force attacks and Denial of Service (DoS), respectively.

A strong security system is required in order to mitigate DoS attacks. Investing in an antivirus software, which
is constantly up to date, will achieve detection and prevention of potential viruses and malware that could harm
the network. Firewalls constructed to protect against these attacks may also be useful, as they can assist in 
monitoring and analysing network traffic (Velimirovic, 2021; Overby, 2021).

To reduce the risk of brute force attacks on the Wi-Fi Protected Setup WPS vulnerability (WPS) PIN, CISA (2013) 
suggested disabling the WPS if and where possible, as some vendors do not allow disabling it (Swan, N.D.). 
Swan (N.D.) also suggests updating the firmware when updates are available. Another solution to mitigating the 
risk of a brute force attack and making the attack “impractical” is the implementation of
“sufficiently long lock-down periods” (Viehböck, 2011).

									<li>The seminar focused on the Microsoft STRIDE and DREAD tools, as discussed in Unit’s 1 lecturecast. The preparation for this seminar was to analyse the vulnerabilities discussed in the article (Unit 1) and analyse them using a 3 level DREAD rating (0 = no risk, 3 = maximum risk). During the live seminar each group presented a short PowerPoint presentation, prepared beforehand, on their DREAD analysis. Our group (Group 3) also mentioned some mitigation solutions for the vulnerabilities discussed in the paper, brute-force and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.</li>
									<li>The seminar offered a glance on what it is like being in a team and working in one, while simultaneously it offered teamwork skills. Due to different time zones and schedules, the teamwork immediately felt less easy, as there needed, and needs to be understanding of the two major factors that could impact a team’s work. Despite these complications, our group managed to work together by sharing documents and organised a meeting to finalise our presentation.</li>

									<summary><b>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1: Threats and Vulnerabilities and Solutions for Mitigation of a Medical Mannequin: Summary Post</b></summary>
									<br>
									<pre>
Glisson et. al.’s (2015) paper emphasises on the healthcare industry being dependent on technology.
This dependence awakens vulnerabilities followed by potential threats in the cyber field. The 
paper focuses on a medical training mannequin being tested for how viable it is. Vulnerabilities
were detected and threats such as brute force and denial of service (DoS) successfully attacked
the mannequin. These attacks automatically have as a consequence the danger of thousands of lives,
as medical personnel will end up with incorrect life-threatening data analysis.

Mitigation suggestions for both, brute force and DoS attacks, were discussed. Disabling the Wi-Fi
Protection Setup (WPS) wherever it is possible, was suggested by CISA (2013) as a mitigating 
solution for brute force attacks, as well as keeping the firmware consistently updated (Swan, N.D.).
Vieböck’s (2011) suggestion was to implement “sufficiently long lock-down periods”, while passwords
should be strong i.e., long, and complex (Necat, 2022). Necat (2022) also suggested that by limiting
failed login attempts within an assigned period, the time required to brute force a password will 
increase.

Although there were mitigating suggestion for brute force attacks, the discussion’s responses focused
more on DoS attacks mitigation. Necat (2022) considers firewalls to be the “first line of defence” 
for DoS attacks. Ahmad, A. (2022) and Ahmad, H. (2022) both suggested investing in an up-to-date 
antivirus. Ahmad, H. (2022) also mentioned the importance of improvement in the network’s security 
features, due to Wi-Fi networks being prone to attacks, resulting in the avoidance of unauthorised 
access and intrusion. Two-Factor Authentication can provide a supplementary layer of security by requi-
ring an additional factor for authorisation such as hardware tokens, OTPs, etcetera (Tan et. al., 2021).
Lastly, having a strong response plan in case of such attack, could assist in ensuring a more prompt and
effective response towards the attack (David, 2021).

As the healthcare industry relies progressively on technology, vulnerabilities and threats will rise.
As a result, patients’ lives will be on stake, therefore investing in a strong cybersecurity system to
mitigate/prevent such threats is vital.

									<summary><b>Practical and Team Activity</b></summary>
									<br>
									<p>This activity required to put our knowledge into practice. Given a specific website (Group 3 had www.customersrus.co.uk) our group had to individually perform a basic scan, using standard tools such as traceroute, whois, dig and ns lookup. Once the scan was performed, we had to answer to some questions.</p>
									<li>How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?</li>
										<li>Using traceroute tool, the number of hops were 12 to 64 hops maximum.</li>
									<li>Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that delay?</li>
										<li>Traceroute tool also aided in identifying the hop with the biggest delay of 246.879 ms with an average duration of 127.208 ms.</li>
									<li>What are the main nameservers for the website?</li>
										<li>Using dig ns tool on the assigned website (www.customersrus.co.uk), the four main nameservers are:</li>
											<li>ns1.a2hosting.com</li>
											<li>ns2.a2hosting.com</li>
											<li>ns3.a2hosting.com</li>
											<li>ns4.a2hosting.com</li>
									<li>Who is the registered contact?</li>
										<li>Using the whois tool, the registered contact is eNom LLC (URL: www.enom.com)</li>
									<li>What is the MX record for the website?</li>
										<li>Using ns lookup and setting the type to mx, the MX record was found to be 0.</li>
									<li>Where is the website hosted?</li>
										<li>And finally, using a web-based tool, https://tools.keycdn.com, the website is seen hosted in US, North America.</li>

									<details>
										<summary><b>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2: Scanning Exercise and Results</b></summary>
										<br>
										<pre>
Our group (Group 3), decided to complete the scanning individually, sharing our results
later on with each other. I worked on a MacOS system using tools on the Terminal for 
answering most questions.

For the first question, I got 12 to 64 hops maximum, using traceroute on the Terminal.
The information I gathered from using traceroute also helped me identify the biggest 
delay of 246.879 ms on the 11th hop.

Moving on with the third question, I used the dig ns tool to obtain the main nameservers,
being:

1. ns1.a2hosting.com

2. ns2.a2hosting.com

3. ns3.a2hosting.com

4. ns4.a2hosting.com

Using the whois tool I was able to identify the registered contact, which was eNom LLC
(URL: www.enom.com).

Nslookup tool aided in the finding of the MX record of the website. To do so, the type
was set to mx and could be seen that there were 0 MX records.

Finally, to find where the website is hosted (using the IP address which was identified
initially using traceroute), a web-based tool; https://tools.keycdn.com, was used and 
it showed that the website is being hosted in US, North America.

										<summary><b>Seminar Preparation Unit 4</b></summary>

For this unit’s seminar, the Russel’s (2006) article was provided. The seminar question
was whether the Internet we have today would be much better if it was based on the 
ISO/OSI 7-layer model rather than TCP/IP?
After reading the article and how basing the Internet on the ISO/OSI 7-layer model 
would affect it, I believe the TCP/IP was the best choice after all. The article 
mentioned that:

-	The slow standardisation process of ISO/OSI 7-layered model failed to keep 
	up with the more effective mechanisms.
	
-	TCP/IP developed through constant experimentation, while ISO/OSI was bureaucratic
	and not related with existing networks and computers.
	
-	ISO/OSI was characterised as Prescriptive. TCP/IP being characterised as 
	Descriptive meant it was more suitable for technology.
	
-	TCP/IP participants did not have to achieve unanimity, but the updates could 
	be passed if supported by the majority. This approach is called “rough consensus”
	and due to this approach, new features and updates can be implemented faster to keep
	up with the Internet.
	
-	To advance a TCP/IP proposal along the standards track, testing and demonstration 
	should be provided. ISO/OSI changes are based on theory and therefore lack security.
	
-	TCP/IP’s open and decentralised architecture gives everyone the opportunity to 
	propose updates, as opposed to ISO/OSI 7-layer protocol, which the updates are only
	suggested by the members.

									<summary><b>Seminar 3 Preparation</b></summary>
									<br>
									<pre>
By reading the blog post by Geer (2015) ‘8 Penetration Testing Tools That Will
Do the Job’, the following penetration tools were rated based on my research 
on the ease of install, ease of use, flexibility, licensing, and reputation of
each tool, from 1-5 (5 being the most popular/highest score).

Ease of Install: 1-5 (5 being the easiest to install)
Ease of Use: 1-5 (5 being the easiest to use i.e., no additional knowledge needed)
Flexibility: 1-5 (5 being available to all OS)
Licensing: 1-5 (5 being free tools, 1 being the most expensive)
Reputation: 1-5 (5 being the most popular and efficient)

As seen in the table below the highest rated tools were Metasploit and OWASP ZAP.
Most tools seemed to be easy to install, flexible and with good reputation. 
Pricing and the ease of use were the categories/factors that impacted some tools
to have a lower rating. From my perspective, ease of use is not considered an issue,
as practice and experience will help build up confidence when using the tools. 
A factor which I consider to be important is the flexibility of a tool. For example,
I am not familiar with the Linux OS and some tools are only available when using Linux.
