							<pre>
Cyber security has become one of the main global issues. Businesses, governments, and households are constantly becoming victims
of sophisticated cybercrimes, which violate the cyber security infrastructure. Due to these crimes, economic disruptions, financial
losses, geopolitical tensions, and social instability come as a result (Di Caro, 2021).

An example is the Facebook incident in 2018. Facebook is a social networking site (Mazman & Usluel, 2010) and to be a part of it and
be visible to other users, it is required to provide a name, gender, date of birth and an e-mail address. Users can become “friends” 
with each other and have interactions (boyd & Hargittai, 2010).

In 2013, a third-party application was created by Dr. Alexandr Kogan, which collected data from around 87 million people, including 
user’s friends who did not download the application, but rather had their privacy settings set to allow data collection (Kang & Frenkel, 2018).
Although, this was not defined as a data breach (Kovilaty, 2018), users who did not give consent to the third-party application to access
their data, despite their privacy settings, felt like it was one (Kozlowska, 2018). Even though Facebook, apologised, as this was a breach
of trust between them and its users and promised to “build a better service” (Zuckerberg, 2018), according to Weisbaum (2018), the users’
confidence in Facebook dropped by 66%.

There is a significant amount of evidence that hackers are successful by cause of human error (Caravello & Jones, 2019). Investing in
cyber security insurance is expensive and companies worry whenever an investment must be made, as they cannot know whether it will
guarantee security or not. Cyber security is not a profit and gain matter, but rather a prevention of losses (Kesswani & Kumar, 2015).
Breaches of data and trust cause harm in relationships between the companies and their customers, which could result in reputational 
damage and potentially lead to companies’ further loss of profits. With that being said, it is vital for companies to invest in 
regularly upgrading their cybersecurity, in order to prevent these types of breaches and minimise the cost of damage.

							<pre>
Data and trust breaches can be damaging to organisations, as it leads to corrupted relationships between them and their customers.
An example is the Facebook’s data breach caused by a third-party application, which collected users’ data to target election parties
with appropriate advertisements. As a result, Facebook users lost confidence in the application, due to the incident (Gallagher, 2018).

Kewalramani (2021) also highlighted the frequency of ransomware attacks and their ability to harm organisations and their reputation. 
He provided a great example; the NHS attack by the WannaCry malware. Based on the National Audit Office’s investigation report (2018),
this attack costed the NHS the loss of trust from the patients, since thousands of appointments, including operations, were cancelled.
WannaCry was stated as an “unsophisticated attack” and could have been prevented, had the NHS followed basic security measures (NAO, 2018).

This shows that data breaches and ransomware attacks are equally damaging and expensive, as any cyberattack is.
Danialou (2021) mentioned the lack of cybersecurity in an organisation’s priority list, because of its high cost.
The lack of complete guarantee that any cyberattack will be repelled, could also be a reason why organisations are hesitant
to invest in cybersecurity (Kesswani & Kumar, 2015). Attackers can use the stolen data to expose the targeted organisation,
including their clients, blackmail them, give them ultimatums; the data for money or the data gets leaked, etc. (Nesbo, 2021).
It is crucial to not underestimate, ignore, and delay the investment in cybersecurity. Organisations should consistently educate
themselves and their staff, learn from other’s mistakes and misfortunes, and consider the importance and need of cybersecurity.
At the end of the day, cybersecurity should not be prioritised based on its cost, but rather on its capability to prevent losses
of any kind, since cyberattacks cost more than the investment.

Cyber security technologies can protect networks, devices and, data from cyberattacks, including malware and viruses (Patterson, 2021).
This initial post will focus on cryptographic systems and anti-malware software.

During 1900 B.C., Egyptians would use hieroglyphs to hide messages from others (Damico, 2009). This shows how cryptography was and is
still being used throughout centuries. Cryptography is mainly used to keep information secret with the help of codes and ciphers. The process
is to encrypt the message and the receiver must decipher it using a string of digits, known as the key. The key is symmetric if it is the same
for both, encryption, and decryption and asymmetric when the two keys differ (Adeyinka, 2008). One of the main benefits of using cryptographic
systems is the assurance of confidentiality. Client’s data is encrypted, meaning it is well protected and therefore applies confidentiality and
prevents client’s legal exposure (Hussein et al., 2016). Another benefit is the reduction of potential security breaches, since the encryption is
on the data, providing a more secure way of transmitting it (Rout & Mishra, 2014). As with everything, there are some drawbacks and weaknesses,
one of them being the chance of a larger key, resulting in a more complex computation. For a symmetric key algorithm guarantee, one must exchange
a private key properly and securely to prevent any chance of exposing it (Hussein et al., 2016).

By CISCO’s definition on malware, ‘malware is intrusive software that is designed to damage and destroy computers and computer systems’ (CISCO, 2021).
Malware includes viruses, spyware, worms, Trojans, et cetera. One cyber security technology which helps intercept any kind of malware is an
anti-malware software (Adeyinka, 2008). Anti-malware software protects the software from viruses and prevents them from harming both, software,
and hardware. Spyware attacks and spam emails can also be prevented from stealing data. In most programs, firewalls are included, ensuring a better
protection by double checking information that was sent. On the other hand, these programs might not provide complete security, due to the lack of
more advanced protection features. In case there is a security hole, there is a higher chance of malware attacks to happen (Roomi, 2020). Lastly, many
users complained about their slow computer systems caused by the programs (Yan & Ansari, 2009), as they use numerous resources from the hard drive and
memory (Roomi, 2020).

Cryptography is considered to be one of the most important cybersecurity technologies for securing businesses’ data (Gruhn & Probst, 2021), while
anti-malware software protects businesses from different types of malware, such as ransomware, spyware and, phishing attacks (IT Governance, 2021).
Both technologies offer security and protection of data either by encrypting it or scanning through it for possible attacks. Even though they both
have their drawbacks, in my opinion, the benefits outweigh the weaknesses, as cryptographic systems and anti-malware software have shown to be important
in securing and protecting data (Moraes et al., 2014; Quantec, 2019).

Cybersecurity technologies are vital for protecting devices, data, and networks. Cryptography is one of the many technologies
keeping information secret by encrypting it. Another technology is anti-malware software, which helps prevent malware and protects
the software and hardware from potential threats (Adeyinka, 2008).

Both technologies offer many benefits to provide security online. With the CIA triad, by encrypting data, cryptography achieves
confidentiality, while also reducing the risk of breaches, ensuring integrity as well (Hussein et. al., 2016). Anti-malware software
offers software protection from malware and prevents potential hardware harm and data theft. Most programs offer firewalls to ensure
better protection, as the information sent will be double-checked (Roomi, 2020).

Osarodion (2022) has introduced hybrid encryption systems to the discussion, which is the combination of asymmetric and symmetric
encryption (Techopedia, 2012). Hybrid encryption could be more efficient and provide higher security, as it takes less time to encrypt
and reduces the risk of key theft in transit (Abroshan, 2021), overcoming the disadvantages of asymmetric and symmetric encryption,
respectively (Hughes, N.D.; Stubbs, 2019).

Angelides (2021) has made a valid point about free anti-malware software users. Free versions of anti-malware software lack some advanced
features, which are provided by the paid versions. In addition, she suggested that the software’s subscription should be updated regularly,
for a faster detection and prevention of new malware (Kaspersky, 2022). Danialou (2021), has shared his concern about malware encryption and
how it has impacted cybersecurity. While anti-malware software on its own might not be ideal for providing a high-level security protection
for organisations’ assets and data, it is also the organisations’ responsibility to educate their staff to constantly browse safely and cautiously,
and monitor every activity, which could help detect potential encrypted malware. Lastly, another solution is storing some data in the cloud, to
protect the hardware from unethical acts, while storing secure backups offline to protect them from possible threats (Panda Security, 2019).

Introduction

For many years booking and scheduling appointments have been managed manually by a person, who is usually behind the reception of a clinic. This method
required and still requires patients to call and wait for their turn, once the phone line is available. The process is time consuming as many people 
live busy lives and could also be a hustle for the staff trying to find an appropriate and convenient date and time to book an appointment with the patient.
Web-based appointment and scheduling management information systems (ASMIS) offer many benefits regarding patient satisfaction as well as staff convenience. 
For ASMIS to allocate the ideal specialist for a given case, vital data from patients must be collected. Due to the high cybercrime rate these days, this 
report will investigate potential cybersecurity threats and how these can be mitigated and prevented to protect the clinic and its patients from the 
cyberattacks discussed later. This report will also use attack trees to understand and identify possible threats, as well as protection trees to find ways
on how these threats can be mitigated. Attack trees are used to understand the attacker, their abilities, and motivations (Saini et. al., 2008), while
protection trees ensure countermeasures which will help achieve prevention of the attacks mentioned in attack trees (Edge et. al., 2006). The report will
include an abuse case diagram, which is often used to describe various ways users can attack an application, in this case ASMIS. Abuse case diagrams are 
useful when identifying and analysing security requirements (Srivatanakul et. al., 2004) and may help in designing countermeasures against the abuse case 
(Synopsys Editorial Team, 2015).

Benefits of ASMIS

ASMIS often offers many benefits to staff and patients of the clinic. It is a convenient system for booking an appointment with the clinic, as it is more
patient-centred due to patients having their freedom while deciding to book an appointment based on their preferences (Zhao, et. al., 2017). Patients who 
have busy schedules and lives or those who simply prefer to avoid booking an appointment via a phone call will benefit from ASMIS, as it meets their personal
preferences when booking. ASMIS can provide convenience for the patients who wish to quickly book, cancel, or reschedule an appointment (Qaffas & Barker, 2012).
It is a constantly available platform to every patient of the clinic and will provide all available slots left for booking (QLESS, 2021). Zhao et. al. (2017)
reviewed 36 articles discussing 21 web-based medical appointment systems and concluded that using web-based appointment systems has reduced the rate of people
who do not show up for their appointments; often referred to as no-show. No show appointments in health centres often cause unnecessary time and money consumption,
as well as disruption when it comes to the continuity of patients’ care (Pfeifer, 2021). Zhao’s et. al. (2017) study also mentioned that web-based medical 
appointment systems decreased staff labour and waiting time and showed improvement in patient satisfaction (Zhao et. al., 2017). Manually booking and cancelling 
appointments could potentially cause human errors such as overbooking or forgotten cancelled appointments, resulting in empty available time slots 
(Qaffas & Barker, 2012).

Security Weaknesses of ASMIS

Although ASMIS offers many benefits, two of the main reasons organisations are discouraged from investing in web-based appointment systems are the cost and safety 
of the system (Zhao et. al., 2017). Even though there are many free web-based systems provided online, organisations who hold vital information of clients, such as
clinics, should invest in a much more secured system. As requested, ASMIS will have the ability to direct clients to the ideal specialist according to the clients’
cases. To achieve this, the web-based system must collect important and personal information and data from the patient/client, meaning the data will be stored in 
the system. Thus, the clinic automatically becomes a target of potential cyberattacks such as data breaches, malware, ransomware attacks, etc. Personal information 
and data should be kept private, strictly confidential and protected from these attacks. Having a robust cybersecurity system is of vital importance, as these
attacks are becoming more frequent and dangerous, causing harm to both, clients and organisations.

Identity Theft
When cyberattacks occur, they usually cause a lot of damage and distress, as they affect the organisation financially, emotionally, and reputationally. Identity 
theft is one of the many outcomes of a cyberattack, as attackers can gather information about patients’ identities (name, surname, home address, credit card 
details, etc.) resulting in a negative impact on their personal lives and financial status. According to ActionFraud (2018), an identity fraud can vary from 
obtaining one’s personal documents such as IDs, passports, to opening bank accounts on the individual’s name. As presented in Figure 1, malicious staff could 
also be responsible for a patient’s identity theft. They have the authority to access the system, which includes patients’ data, and can steal the information 
needed directly, in order to proceed with their intentions. These kinds of actions are mostly performed during work hours and may continue even though the 
insider has fulfilled their goal (Ekran, 2021). Identity theft can also be caused by outsiders; hackers (Figure 1). Two possible ways a hacker could have been 
granted access to the system, are by simply guessing one of the user’s passwords either manually or using a computer; often referred to as brute-force 
(Fortinet, 2022a), or by phishing; hackers send out legitimate looking e-mails or texts which include a malicious link/attachment that once clicked, the malware 
either downloads itself or ask for personal details (Muncaster, 2022).

Person with Unauthorised Access (Hacker)

By Fortinet’s (2022b) definition, hacking is “the act of compromising digital devices and networks through unauthorized access to an account or computer system”. 
Figure 2 presents an abuse case on attackers who access the system without the appropriate authority and the potential threats derived from them. As shown in 
Figure 2, a person with unauthorised access may steal sensitive data, in this case patients’ data. By accessing the system, it is likely the clinic will be 
threatened by an organised ransomware attack (Egnyte, 2022). Attackers whose goal is to publicise the clinic’s data will organise and cause breach of data 
(Kaspersky, 2022a). By Kaspersky’s (2022a) definition on data breaches, “a data breach exposes confidential, sensitive, or protected information to an unauthorized
person”. Once a data breach occurs, it will immediately harm the clinic’s reputation and finances, whilst putting the patients at risk, as their data and personal 
information stored in the clinic’s system might be misused. The latter will be followed by a breach of trust between the clinic and their patients, as they might 
not feel secure providing the clinic with the required information again (Kaspersky, 2022a).

Security Protection Against Threats

Protection Against Malicious Staff

Theoretically, malicious staff as a threat is much harder to identify than someone from the outside trying to break in the system, as they have authorised access
to the clinic (Ekran, 2021). Malicious staff threats can be mitigated by limiting access to what employees need access to (Figure 3). By doing so, less people 
have access to more sensitive data and enhances security to patients’ data. It also makes it much easier to detect the person responsible for stealing data, as 
less people will be considered as suspects. Monitoring the network will ensure the identification of warning signs such as unusual logins from employees, excessive
printing and attempting to gain unauthorised access. It is also important for the IT department to block former employees’ authority to enter the system and have 
background checks on present and future employees. Employees who had been given poor review or did not get a raise/promotion, are often the most dangerous, as they
might feel neglected and be persuaded in turning against the clinic (Interguard, 2019).

Multi-Factor Authentication and Two-Factor Authentication
To mitigate and protect the clinic’s reputation and data from cyber threats, it is vital to construct a high-level security for the ASMIS. The protection tree as
shown in Figure 3, aims to protect the system from the identity theft threat, either coming from malicious insiders or from a hacker. In the case of a brute-force,
it is suggested to invest in multi-factor authentication (MFA) or a two-factor authentication (2FA). This technique helps by adding another layer of security to 
make it more difficult for hackers to access the system and steal data. Since MFA and 2FA work in a way that requires second confirmation of authentication, such
as an OTP or a fingerprint, the hacker would need both authentication factors (NIST, 2022). According to a Google survey, 2FA is one of the best security 
technologies experts use to protect their systems (Google, 2015). Banks, such as Santander, use the 2FA security technique to confirm it is the authorised
user logging in their account and using their Online Banking System (Santander, N.D.). Although MFA/2FA does not guarantee security from all cyberattacks, 
it can help secure sensitive data, in this case the patients’ (OneLogin, 2022). Another drawback is the cost following the MFA/2FA technology, as most 
technologies come with a cost, especially for additional support. (Carter, 2017).

Anti-Malware Software
As indicated in Figure 3, to prevent patients from becoming victims of phishing attacks it is strongly suggested to educate them on identifying phishing
emails or texts. Based on Kaspersky (2022b), these e-mails or texts often contain links/attachments, spelling errors, poor grammar, etc. to imitate a 
website or company. Once they are recognised and categorised as phishing e-mails/texts it is suggested to immediately delete the e-mail/message, block 
the sender, and invest in an extra layer of security, such as an anti-malware software. This type of software can prevent and protect users’ systems 
from malware, as most of them include firewalls to double check sent information (Roomi, 2020). However, there have been complaints that the software
may slow computers down (Yan & Ansari, 2009) as these programs use resources from both hard drive and memory. Although there are free anti-malware
software versions, it is strongly suggested the patients engage in a paid anti-malware software, as it provides more advanced security features than the
free version (Roomi, 2020).

Data Encryption

Anti-malware software, as discussed above, offers security to sensitive data, keeping system, applications and data protected. Thus, it is vital 
for the clinic as well to invest in an anti-malware software. Specifically, it can also be helpful in preventing potential ransomware attacks from 
people who have gained unauthorised access (Acronics, 2022). Another cybersecurity technology used by many businesses, such as Facebook and Google 
(Opsahl et. al., 2014), to protect their data from hackers/people with unauthorised access, as explained in Figure 2, is data encryption. Encryption 
is the process of converting data into ciphertext, keeping the information secret by using codes and ciphers (Janacek, 2018; Adeyinka, 2008). By 
encrypting patients’ data, confidentiality and integrity are ensured as the data is well protected. This automatically reduces the risk of potential 
security breaches, including the hacker’s intentions mentioned in Figure 2 (Hussein et. al. 2016). Data encryption does not guarantee a complete 
security system but offers security to data stored in the system and mitigates the risk of stolen data, breach of data and ransomware attacks, as 
it will be encrypted and therefore useless to the person with unauthorised access (Janacek, 2018).

Conclusion

To conclude, ASMIS is beneficial for the clinic as it is a convenient system to have. It is patient centred, meaning they have more freedom in booking 
their appointments. Although it offers many benefits, patients will have to share sensitive information for ASMIS to satisfy all requirements. Sharing 
this information with the system will open doors for potential threats, either from internal or external parties; one of them being identity theft. It 
can be caused by malicious staff who have authorised access or by hackers using brute-force or phishing to gain access. Both acts can cause emotional, 
financial, and reputational damage for both patients and the clinic. Limiting authorised access and blocking former personnel from accessing the system 
will reduce the risk of malicious acts from the staff. It is also important for the IT department to monitor the network for unusual and suspicious 
activities. It is suggested that ASMIS uses an MFA/2FA system to mitigate the risk of the user’s account being hacked. It is worth mentioning that 
security is not necessarily guaranteed, but it offers additional protection. Educating patients to identify phishing e-mails/texts will help them from
being victimised by them. Patients are also advised to use a strong anti-malware software for malware protection, even though there have been accusations 
on slowing down computers. People with unauthorised access to ASMIS could steal patients’ data and threaten the clinic by organising a ransomware attack 
or breach of data. Anti-malware software can mitigate the risk of such attacks. Data encryption may not guarantee security in all aspects, nevertheless 
it protects data, ensuring confidentiality and integrity, while also reducing the risk of security breaches. Although most cybersecurity technologies 
come with a cost, it is vital for the clinic to invest in them as they protect the system and mitigate the risk of discussed threats.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) offers additional layers of security to a user’s online account in case of a stolen password (Microsoft, 2022). 
Generally, there are three types of MFA; something the user knows (such as a password), something that the user possesses (such as a smart phone), 
and something the user is (such as a fingerprint) (Stewart, 2018). Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a system using two of these options, while the
MFA system might use more than two (Griffith, 2022). One example of 2FA could be a system where a username and a password are required for a user to
access the system, but so is a confidential code, often referred to as One-Time Password (OTP), only the authorised user possesses. This code can be
sent to the user’s mobile phone number, or it can be generated from an application changing the code over short periods of time, often referred to as
Time-based OTP (TOTP). 2FA is often used to achieve reduction in the risk of unauthorised access, with or without malicious intentions (Crum & Forster, 2018).
One of the most popular applications using TOTPs is the Google Authenticator application, and it often uses a 6-digit numerical code which is constantly
updated (Freedman, 2022).

This code implements and mimics the Two-Factor Authentication principle. It contains two classes, each containing one function to provide simplicity in
reading and understanding. The first class (class OTP) is created to generate and verify the OTP, while the second class (class LogIn) is created to 
ask the user for the username and password. Running the program will initially execute the LogIn’s function (askuser) and prompt the user for the username
and password. If the user types in incorrect details, the program will ask them to try again, as either the username, password or both are incorrect. 
The user has no more than three attempts for logging in with the correct details and if they fail to do so, the program will terminate. In case the user 
inputs the correct details, the program will continue, and the class OTP’s function (otpgeneratorverification) will run. This function was created to 
generate and verify the OTP which the user must input correctly in order to ‘access’ the system. It creates a unique and random 6-digit numerical code 
every time it executes and prints it as an output for the user to see. The user is then asked to input the displayed OTP and if it is correctly entered,
the function will classify it as verified, meaning the user would have gained access to the system. Otherwise, the user is informed that the inputted 
code is not identical with the generated OTP, resulting in the termination of the program. Lastly, the code includes a dictionary for testing purposes
called patients, where the key is the username, and the associated value is the password of a patient. In this case, two users were created to test the
code with the usernames johnsmith and maryjones with the passwords Password123! and 123Password! respectively.

As mentioned above, the code mimics the 2FA principle and displays the OTP as an output, due to the limitation of not writing a code involving the use
of external devices. Undoubtably, the OTP should never be printed for anyone to see and should be strictly confidential to the user, as this does not 
provide safety and contradicts the 2FA principle. To achieve an ideal 2FA system for this particular case, external devices (such as mobile phones)
are required for OTPs to be sent and used as a second authenticator. It is worth mentioning that smart phones are not the only source of a secure 
account and a successful 2FA system, as other organisations achieve 2FA with the use of biometric devices, QR codes and many more (Vigliarolo, 2020).
