							<h1>Launching Into Cyber Security</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This module introduces us to cybersecurity, inlcuding its ethics, responsibilities, the types of threats, etc.</p>
							<p><b>Unit 1-3: Collaborative Discussion</b></p>
							<p>For our first collaborative discussion, we were asked to discuss reasons why cybersecurity has become a global issue and the importance of investing in Cyber Security. My initial discussion focused on the social media platform, Facebook, and the 'data breach' and breach of trust incident caused by a third party application in 2018. The third party application collected data from users to target them with political advertisements, leading to the loss of confidence in Facebook from its users. Data breaches and breaches of trust are not the only serious cyber attacks out there. Ransomware attacks also have the ability to cause harm in companies and organisations and obviously their reputation. A peer response from the discussion mentioned the NHS ransomware attack, WannaCry. NHS had to pay millions in total to recover from the malware, but also lost the trust from many patients, since thousands of appointments, including operations, where cancelled. Patients who had to attend to the emergency room travalled further to find a hospital that was not targreted by the attack. These incidents show that cyber attacks cause a lot of damage, not only from the financial aspect of it, but can also harm relationships between organisations/companies and their clients.</p>
							<p>Cybersecurity should be considered to prevent losses and not a matter of profit and gain. The cost and lack of guarantee that any cyber attack will be prevented, could be reasons why more people are not investing in cybersecurity systems. Although investing in cybersecurity can be costly, it most definitely does not cost more than the handling of an attack. Cyberattacks are becoming more and more frequent everyday, some are easier to control and some may cause damage that cannot be fixed. It is vital for everyone to be educated on the cybersecurity topic, from children to adults, as almost everyone has access to digital devices. Companies and organisations should prioritise the investment in cybersecurity, not only for their own benefit, but also consider the human element. </p>
