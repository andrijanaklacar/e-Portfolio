							<h1>Launching Into Cyber Security</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This module introduces us to cybersecurity, inlcuding its ethics, responsibilities, the types of threats, etc.</p>
							<p><b>Unit 1-3: Collaborative Discussion</b></p>
							<p><b>Initial Post:</b></p>
							<p>Cyber security has become one of the main global issues. Businesses, governments, and households are constantly becoming victims of sophisticated cybercrimes, which violate the cyber security infrastructure. Due to these crimes, economic disruptions, financial losses, geopolitical tensions, and social instability come as a result (Di Caro, 2021).</p>
							<p>An example is the Facebook incident in 2018. Facebook is a social networking site (Mazman & Usluel, 2010) and to be a part of it and be visible to other users, it is required to provide a name, gender, date of birth and an e-mail address. Users can become “friends” with each other and have interactions (boyd & Hargittai, 2010).</p>
							<p>In 2013, a third-party application was created by Dr. Alexandr Kogan, which collected data from around 87 million people, including user’s friends who did not download the application, but rather had their privacy settings set to allow data collection (Kang & Frenkel, 2018). Although, this was not defined as a data breach (Kovilaty, 2018), users who did not give consent to the third-party application to access their data, despite their privacy settings, felt like it was one (Kozlowska, 2018). Even though Facebook, apologised, as this was a breach of trust between them and its users and promised to “build a better service” (Zuckerberg, 2018), according to Weisbaum (2018), the users’ confidence in Facebook dropped by 66%.</p>
							<p>There is a significant amount of evidence that hackers are successful by cause of human error (Caravello & Jones, 2019). Investing in cyber security insurance is expensive and companies worry whenever an investment must be made, as they cannot know whether it will guarantee security or not. Cyber security is not a profit and gain matter, but rather a prevention of losses (Kesswani & Kumar, 2015). Breaches of data and trust cause harm in relationships between the companies and their customers, which could result in reputational damage and potentially lead to companies’ further loss of profits. With that being said, it is vital for companies to invest in regularly upgrading their cybersecurity, in order to prevent these types of breaches and minimise the cost of damage.</p>

							<p><b>Summary:</b></p>
							<p>Data and trust breaches can be damaging to organisations, as it leads to corrupted relationships between them and their customers. An example is the Facebook’s data breach caused by a third-party application, which collected users’ data to target election parties with appropriate advertisements. As a result, Facebook users lost confidence in the application, due to the incident (Gallagher, 2018).</p>
							<p>Kewalramani (2021) also highlighted the frequency of ransomware attacks and their ability to harm organisations and their reputation. He provided a great example; the NHS attack by the WannaCry malware. Based on the National Audit Office’s investigation report (2018), this attack costed the NHS the loss of trust from the patients, since thousands of appointments, including operations, were cancelled. WannaCry was stated as an “unsophisticated attack” and could have been prevented, had the NHS followed basic security measures (NAO, 2018).</p>
							<p>This shows that data breaches and ransomware attacks are equally damaging and expensive, as any cyberattack is. Danialou (2021) mentioned the lack of cybersecurity in an organisation’s priority list, because of its high cost. The lack of complete guarantee that any cyberattack will be repelled, could also be a reason why organisations are hesitant to invest in cybersecurity (Kesswani & Kumar, 2015). Attackers can use the stolen data to expose the targeted organisation, including their clients, blackmail them, give them ultimatums; the data for money or the data gets leaked, etc. (Nesbo, 2021). It is crucial to not underestimate, ignore, and delay the investment in cybersecurity. Organisations should consistently educate themselves and their staff, learn from other’s mistakes and misfortunes, and consider the importance and need of cybersecurity. At the end of the day, cybersecurity should not be prioritised based on its cost, but rather on its capability to prevent losses of any kind, since cyberattacks cost more than the investment.</p>
